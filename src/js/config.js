//VERY IMPORTANT! Repeated and important variables that define importnat data about the app are located here. If API URL changes, its better to declare in one place and change from here which applies across all modules

export const API_URL = 'https://forkify-api.herokuapp.com/api/v2/recipes/'; //NOTE: a special constant that would never change is named with uppercase letters like 'PI'
export const TIMEOUT_SEC = 10;
